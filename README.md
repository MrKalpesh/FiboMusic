# Welcome to FiboMusic!
This is the implementation of the Music generation using **Fibonacci** series.

## How its works?

 1. First we generate the list fibonacci numbers.
 2. Split the each number into digits form and store it to array.
 3. We have assigned digit **1 to 7** to  ***C minor*** scale, **8 & 9** digit to the ***E minor*** and **0** digit to ***A minor***
 4. We traverse over the digits array and play the respective scale.
